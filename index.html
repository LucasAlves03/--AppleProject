        <h1 class="text-center">How it all began?</h1>
        <div class="col-md">
           <p>Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne created Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976, to market Wozniak's Apple I desktop computer, and Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California.</p>
           

          <p class="py-2">For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998</p>
          <p>With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of June 30, 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018. Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011 and $156 billion in 2012.</p>

                <h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
                <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American inventor, entrepreneur, and computer tycoon. He distinguished himself as co-founder, president and CEO of Apple Inc. and for revolutionizing six industries: personal computers, animated films, music, phones, tablets, and digital publishing. In addition to his ties to Apple, he was chief executive officer of the computer graphics animation company Pixar and the maximum individual shareholder of The Walt Disney Company. He died on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, from pancreatic cancer.</p>
                <p>
                    In the late 1970s, Jobs, in partnership with Steve Wozniak and Mike Markkula, among others, developed and marketed one of the first successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series. In the early 1980s, he was among the first to see the commercial potential of the Mouse-guided (computer) graphical user interface, which led to the creation of the Macintosh.

He co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.), along with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, on April 1, 1976, providing critical administrative oversight for the new venture. Twelve days later, he sold his 10% stake in the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 (equivalent to $3,810 in 2021), and a year later accepted a final $1,500 (equivalent to $1,500 in 2021). 7,143 in 2021) to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly merged Apple.</p>
